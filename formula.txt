## **1. Roof Area Calculations**

### **Area Conversion Formula**
```
usable_area_m² = roof_area_sqft × 0.092903
```

**Purpose:** Converts square feet to square meters for international calculations.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **0.092903** is the exact conversion factor from square feet to square meters
- Solar industry calculations are typically done in metric units (m²)
- Example: 2,000 sq ft × 0.092903 = 185.8 m²
- This standardizes measurements for global solar panel specifications

### **Roof Percentage Analysis**
```
roof_percentage = roof_pixels ÷ total_pixels
```

**Purpose:** Determines what portion of the satellite image contains the roof.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **roof_pixels:** Number of pixels identified as roof area by computer vision
- **total_pixels:** Total pixels in the entire image (width × height)
- Result is a decimal between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.4 = 40% of image is roof)
- Used to estimate actual roof size based on image analysis
- Higher percentages indicate larger roofs or closer satellite images

### **Usable Area After Obstacles**
```
usable_area = detected_area × 0.75
```

**Purpose:** Accounts for unusable roof space due to obstacles and structural limitations.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **0.75 factor** represents 75% usability after removing obstacles
- Accounts for: chimneys, vents, HVAC units, roof edges, fire setbacks
- Industry standard: 20-30% of roof area is typically unusable
- Conservative estimate ensures realistic panel placement
- Example: 2,000 sq ft roof → 1,500 sq ft usable area

## **2. Solar Panel System Sizing**

### **Maximum Panel Count**
```
max_panels = ⌊(usable_area_m² ÷ panel_area) × packing_efficiency⌋
```

**Purpose:** Calculates maximum number of panels that can fit on the roof.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **panel_area = 2.0 m²:** Standard residential solar panel size (2m × 1m)
- **packing_efficiency = 0.85:** 85% efficiency accounts for spacing, wiring, access
- **⌊⌋ (floor function):** Rounds down to whole panels (can't install partial panels)
- **15% loss** due to: panel spacing, inverter placement, walkways, irregular roof shapes
- Example: 100 m² ÷ 2.0 × 0.85 = 42.5 → 42 panels maximum

### **Panel Wattage**
```
panel_wattage = panel_efficiency × 1000 × panel_area
```

**Purpose:** Calculates the power output of each individual panel.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **panel_efficiency:** Decimal efficiency (0.24 = 24% for monocrystalline)
- **1000:** Converts to watts (1000 W/m² standard test conditions)
- **panel_area:** Physical panel size in square meters
- Standard test conditions: 1000 W/m² irradiance, 25°C, AM 1.5 spectrum
- Example: 0.24 × 1000 × 2.0 = 480 watts per panel

### **System Capacity**
```
system_capacity_kW = (max_panels × panel_wattage) ÷ 1000
```

**Purpose:** Determines total system power capacity in kilowatts.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **max_panels:** Number of panels that fit on roof
- **panel_wattage:** Individual panel power output
- **÷ 1000:** Converts watts to kilowatts for standard industry measurement
- This is the "nameplate capacity" used for permits and utility interconnection
- Example: 42 panels × 480W ÷ 1000 = 20.16 kW system

## **3. Energy Production Calculations**

### **Base Annual Production**
```
annual_irradiance = location_irradiance × 365
base_production = system_capacity × annual_irradiance
```

**Purpose:** Calculates theoretical annual energy production without losses.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **location_irradiance:** Daily solar energy per m² for specific location (kWh/m²/day)
- **365:** Days per year
- **base_production:** Theoretical maximum energy if panels operated at peak efficiency
- Does not account for real-world losses (shading, temperature, inverter efficiency)
- Example: 5.26 kWh/m²/day × 365 = 1,920 kWh/m²/year

### **Comprehensive Energy Production**
```
annual_production = base_production × shading_factor × orientation_factor × tilt_factor × temperature_factor
```

**Purpose:** Applies real-world efficiency losses to get accurate production estimate.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **base_production:** Theoretical maximum from previous calculation
- **Multiple factors** account for different types of energy losses
- Each factor is a decimal ≤ 1.0 (representing percentage efficiency)
- Factors are multiplied together for cumulative effect
- Result is realistic annual energy production in kWh

### **Efficiency Factors**

#### **Shading Factor**
```
shading_factor = (100 - shading_percentage) ÷ 100
```

**Purpose:** Reduces production based on roof shading from trees, buildings, or obstacles.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **shading_percentage:** Percentage of roof affected by shadows (0-100)
- **Conversion to factor:** 20% shading → 0.8 factor (80% efficiency)
- Shading has disproportionate impact due to series wiring of panels
- Even partial shading can significantly reduce system output
- Example: 15% shading → (100-15)÷100 = 0.85 factor

#### **Orientation Factors**
- **South: 1.0** (optimal in Northern Hemisphere)
- **Southeast/Southwest: 0.96** (4% loss from optimal)
- **East/West: 0.87** (13% loss)
- **Northeast/Northwest: 0.78** (22% loss)
- **North: 0.65** (35% loss - generally not recommended)

**Purpose:** Adjusts production based on roof orientation relative to sun path.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- Based on solar geometry and sun path throughout the year
- South-facing receives most direct sunlight in Northern Hemisphere
- East/West split daily solar exposure (morning vs. afternoon)
- North-facing receives minimal direct sunlight
- Factors derived from solar modeling software and industry standards

#### **Tilt Factor**
```
deviation = |tilt_angle - 30°|
If deviation ≤ 5°: factor = 1.0
If deviation ≤ 15°: factor = 0.95
If deviation ≤ 25°: factor = 0.90
Else: factor = 0.85
```

**Purpose:** Optimizes production based on panel tilt angle.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **30°** is approximately optimal tilt for most US locations
- **|absolute value|** ensures positive deviation regardless of direction
- Flatter or steeper angles reduce efficiency
- **Stepped function** provides practical ranges rather than complex curves
- Accounts for seasonal sun angle variations

#### **Temperature Factor**
```
If avg_temp > 25°C:
    temperature_factor = 1 - ((avg_temp - 25) × 0.004)
Else:
    temperature_factor = 1.0
```

**Purpose:** Accounts for reduced panel efficiency in high temperatures.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **25°C (77°F):** Standard test condition temperature
- **0.004 (0.4%):** Typical efficiency loss per degree Celsius above 25°C
- Solar panels lose efficiency as temperature increases
- Hot climates see significant production losses despite high sun exposure
- Example: 35°C average → 1 - ((35-25) × 0.004) = 0.96 factor

### **Capacity Factor**
```
capacity_factor = (annual_production ÷ (system_capacity × 8760)) × 100
```

**Purpose:** Measures system efficiency as percentage of theoretical maximum.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **8760:** Hours in a year (24 × 365)
- **system_capacity × 8760:** Theoretical production if system ran at full capacity 24/7
- **Capacity factor:** Industry standard efficiency metric (typically 15-25% for solar)
- Higher values indicate better system performance or location
- Example: 20,000 kWh ÷ (10 kW × 8760) = 22.8% capacity factor
